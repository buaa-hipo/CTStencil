The code of paper "Adapting Combined Tiling to Stencil Optimizations on Sunway Processor".

Each directory contains three implementations for a particular stencil:

- openacc: parallel implementation using OpenACC programming model

- mpe: sequential implementation using standard C programming model

- athread: parallel implementation using Athread programming model
